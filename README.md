# WordBomb
**WordBomb** is a fast-paced party game for you and your friends! It was made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You can play **WordBomb** [here](https://luisjaco.github.io/WordBomb/)! The rules of the game are as follows:

1. First, a category is chosen at random. The starting player will hold the remote.
2. Each round, active players will take turns saying one word relevant to the category.
3. The current player will be timed in each turn, starting at 10 seconds and decreasing as rounds go on.
4. If the current player says a valid word, they may press the `NEXT` button and pass the remote to the next player.
5. If the previous player had repeated a word, the current player may press the `GO AGAIN` button and pass it back to the previous player. The previous player must now say a new word.
6. If the current player cannot say a valid word within the time limit, they are out the game.
7. The game ends when only one player is left.

> [!NOTE]
> **WordBomb** requires an external bluetooth remote (Nintendo JoyCon, Nintendo Wii Remote, Xbox Controller, etc.).
